# **CHAPTER 3 – METHODS OF RESEARCH AND PROCEDURES**

### **Recommended Outline (Final Structure)**

---

## **3.1 Research Methodology**

### 3.1.1 Type of Research

* Descriptive-developmental design
* Descriptive (survey-based evaluation)
* Developmental (system creation & assessment)

### 3.1.2 System Development Methodology

*(High-level only — no technical diagrams; technical details move to Appendix)*

* Agile SDLC overview
* Rationale for selecting Agile
* Brief description of phases (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment)

---

## **3.2 Research Design**

* The conceptual framework (IPO or TAM-based)
* The logic of evaluation (input → process → output)
* Link to problem/objectives

---

## **3.3 Research Locale**

* St. Clare College of Caloocan
* Online/blended learning environment
* Context of online teaching (Google Meet and Zoom) instruction

---

## **3.4 Target Respondents**

* Faculty profile
* Number of respondents
* Inclusion criteria
* Rationale for respondent selection

---

## **3.5 Sampling Technique**

* Purposive sampling (faculty who teach online via Google Meet/Zoom)
* Justification

---

## **3.6 Data Sources**

### 3.6.1 System-Generated Data

* Attendance logs
* Participation logs
* Session metadata
* Performance/accuracy metrics

### 3.6.2 Research Data

* Survey responses (Likert-scale)
* Open-ended feedback
* SUS scores
* Accuracy testing results

---

## **3.7 Research Instruments**

### 3.7.1 Survey Questionnaire

* Sections (demographics, TAM constructs, usability expectations, privacy, open-ended items)

### 3.7.2 System Usability Scale (SUS)

* Use of 10-item standardized metric

### 3.7.3 Accuracy Testing Checklist

* Ground truth vs. detected event comparison
* Precision/recall metrics (detailed formula in Appendix)

### 3.7.4 Instrument Validation

* Expert review (3 validators)
* Pilot testing results

---

## **3.8 Data Gathering Procedure**

*(Process flow from start to finish)*

1. Coordination with faculty
2. Informed consent
3. Survey distribution
4. Use of Engagium prototype (if applicable)
5. SUS and accuracy testing administration
6. Data collection and storage

---

## **3.9 Data Analysis Techniques**

### 3.9.1 Descriptive Statistics

* Frequency counts
* Mean scores
* Likert scale interpretation

### 3.9.2 SUS Score Computation

* Formula
* Interpretation ranges

### 3.9.3 Accuracy Metrics

* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score

### 3.9.4 Qualitative Thematic Analysis

* Coding open-ended responses

---

## **3.10 Ethical Considerations**

* Informed consent
* Data Privacy Act compliance
* Confidentiality
* Voluntary participation
* Anonymity
* Right to withdraw
* Secure data handling
