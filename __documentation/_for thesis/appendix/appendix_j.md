## J.2 Benefit Analysis

### J.2.1 Time Savings

The following table estimates the time savings achieved by using ENGAGIUM compared to manual participation tracking methods.

| Activity | Manual Method (min/session) | With ENGAGIUM (min/session) | Time Saved (min/session) |
|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Attendance Recording | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Participation Monitoring | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Post-Session Documentation | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Report Generation | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| **Total per Session** | **[TBD]** | **[TBD]** | **[TBD]** |

### J.2.2 Projected Time Savings (Per Instructor)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Average sessions per week | [TBD] |
| Weeks per semester | [TBD] |
| Semesters per year | 2 |
| Total sessions per year | [TBD] |
| Time saved per session (minutes) | [TBD] |
| **Total time saved per year (hours)** | **[TBD]** |

### J.2.3 Qualitative Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Improved Accuracy** | Automated tracking eliminates human error in recording attendance and participation events. Manual methods are prone to missed entries, especially during active lectures. |
| **Objectivity & Fairness** | All students are tracked equally using the same criteria, reducing subjective bias in participation grading. |
| **Real-Time Visibility** | Instructors can see engagement as it happens, allowing for immediate pedagogical adjustments during class. |
| **Comprehensive Tracking** | Captures multiple participation types (chat, reactions, hand raises, mic usage) that are difficult to track manually while teaching. |
| **Student Accountability** | Students are aware that participation is being tracked objectively, potentially encouraging more active engagement. |
| **Data-Driven Insights** | Analytics help identify engagement patterns, top participants, and students who may need additional support. |
| **Reduced Administrative Burden** | Less time spent on paperwork means more time available for instruction and student interaction. |
| **Automatic Documentation** | Creates verifiable records for grade disputes, audits, or institutional reporting requirements. |
| **Scalability** | System handles any number of classes and students without additional effort from the instructor. |
| **Consistency Across Sessions** | Standardized tracking ensures consistent participation records across all class meetings. |

### J.3.3 Conclusion

> **[PLACEHOLDER]**
>
> Summary conclusion will be added after actual figures are determined.

ENGAGIUM provides practical value to instructors by automating the tedious task of participation tracking during online classes. While the system required significant development effort, it leverages free and open-source technologies, minimizing direct costs. The primary benefits are non-monetary—time savings, improved accuracy, and enhanced fairness in participation assessment—which align with the academic and pedagogical goals of the project.
